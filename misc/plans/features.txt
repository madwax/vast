Vast Features
=============

- Free-moving spacecraft
- LoD planets
- Galactic systems with sub-systems & planets
- Player as separate entity from spacecraft
- IVA activity within spacecraft
- Alien AI-controlled ships
- Alien being entities
- Noise-based planet generation
- Procedural ocean generation
- Planetary biome generation
- Civilisation generation
- Civilisation simulation
- Civilisation city generation
- Civilisation-based simulated galactic economies
- Voxel-based ship damage
- Procedural ship function (i.e: power lines in ship get destroyed, ship stops working)
- Ship combat modes (attempts to sync velocity vectors with target ships)
- Component-based ship construction (i.e: a ship doesn't have to be space-worthy. You can build things like cars, bikes, hovercraft, submarines, 
low-altitude planes, etc. just as easily)
- Efficient management of voxel bodies (to enable things like large space stations and container ships)
- Well-implemented jump / hyperdrive system
- A lore / virtual science system that attempts to mirror close-future reality where possible (i.e: inter-system jumping is a form of quantum 
tunnelling, ion-accelerated weapons, etc.)
- Atmospheric scattering
- (?) Voxel-based planets with cave systems (I don't think is realistically possible. We're starting to approach the physical limits of computers 
here)
- Realistic atmospheric physics (i.e: burn-up on re-entry causes problems if your ship is damaged)

- Ship building
- Station building
- Vegetation on planets
- FPS/TPS shooter action
