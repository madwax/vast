## What is Vast?

Vast is (or at least aims to be) an open-world space trading and combat simulator. It aims to simulate the entirety of a galaxy containing upwards of 100 billions star systems, each filled with suns, planets and moons that can be explored seamlessly down to metre-by-metre detail with no loading screens or waiting.

Gameplay will be very open, with no overuling objective within the game. The vast quantity of content generated on the fly with procedural techniques should in itself provide a considerable amount of entertainment.

Vast also aims to simulate alien civilisations, with procedurally-generated creatures, technology, cities and ships. These civilisations may be incredibly complex in nature, with wars and other events between civilisations sparking real, in-game scenarios.
